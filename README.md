# Plantoptogenetics
 Arduino controlled LED array for plant optogentics.
 Basic control of 256 RGB LED array that can be used for Arabidopsis growing on plates under red light.  Intermittent blue flashes can be set to examine phenotype of plants expressing optogenetic proteins.
 System can also be used for experimentation for eample measuring membrane potentials or transroot potentials in response to activation of specific ion channels. The LED array has more than enough intensity for photosynthesis and activation.
